# Terms of Service

Detailed explanation about Terms of Service for art commisions

##### Last updated April 2022

## General Information

I do not work with written contracts. However, I do hope that when you commission me you will read my terms of service, and will try to keep these Terms of Service to avoid uncomfortable situations or misunderstandings between us.

When you have questions, feel free to send me a message on social media or pixiv.

I reserve the right to change this file without warning, although the changes are transparently shown as this Terms are tracked by Git.

## Payment

I will only start a commission after payment has been received.

Preferably I accept KoFi donations or Stripe, I also 
support PayPal but only as a last option. 

## Deadlines and waiting times

I do not accept deadlines on any commission, no matter the price, because art is not my main job.
    
For normal sized commissions (with shading and some details), please expect a wait time anywhere from a day to two months. Nevertheless I prefer to give some updates on my commisions publicly. 

## Refunds

If your waiting time for a normal commission would be longer than three months, I will offer a full refund. Whereas a big commision would have a six months waiting time interval before I could offer you a refund.

For all commissions, if you really need a refund because, for example, something nasty has come up and you desperately need the money, send me a message and we can discuss it.

## Work In Progress (WIP)

You can always check my commission progress on my Twitter. There you can check if I have finished the sketching, lineart, flatcolour, shading, and effects stages of a commission.

You can also ask me directly for them if you really need an update on the progress. I would definetely appreciate consideration on this to avoid spamming. 

While sketching, I will always provide a WIP on normal sized to big sized commisions to you, so you could tell me if there are some mistakes or big changes needed.


## General Rules

### What to expect from me

I reserve myself the right to decline your commission and on rare cases, without giving my reasons. 

I am comfortable with drawing mostly humanoids. I'can draw: humans, kemonomimi, anything in between, nude, R18+, backgrounds, some mecha(nical stuff).

The things that I'm not comfortable with are: insanely big body parts (boobs, bellies, some form of expansion ...etc) and unnatural big muscles. If there is something on which I may feel unconfortable with, I will definetly let you know.

If you're not sure about topics, idea, design or details, just ask me. We can discuss further on your idea.

I reserve myself the right to stream the commission, however, I won't stream it if you ask me not to in advance.

I'm allowed to use the finished artwork in my portfolio/profile and to upload it to my social media or art sites. By default I will also credit you as my requester, there is no issue if you dont want that.

### Regarding NSFW (18+)

I will also not draw anything that has to do with extreme political subjects, gore, vore, rape, extreme violency ...etc.

Nudes or suggestive content are totally fine.

Sex is also fine, although I prefer to avoid group sex, cheating/netorare or degradation.

If you have any specific fetish that you may want to introduce, please tell me so I could pay the necessary attention to it.

### What I would expect from you

It is important to me that you tell me about your idea, some background info, details, expresions, the message that you would like to send with the art. All these things help me understand your vision and helps on me having a good artwork that you feel satisfied with.

When a commission is finished, you will receive an (2894 x 4093 pixels) version as default. If you need a smaller resolution or ratio, please tell me in advance.

However, I will not remove my watermark and I ask you kindly not to remove it either. I will not place it in an intrusive way for the artwork, it is just a signature from me.

If you post the commission somewhere, please link back to one of my accounts. Preferably Pixiv (https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/12749913). I would really appreciate it.

I do NOT give you permission to use the commission in any commercial way (e.g. any way that earns you profit in any way), such as selling prints, using the artwork in a game, printing it in an artbook. Of course, you can print it for yourself, but in no way are you allowed to re-sell the artwork.

I do NOT give you permission, under any circumstances, to use any part of the commissioned artwork for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Use of the artwork for any advertising or profits associated with non-fungible tokens or cryptocurrency is strictly prohibited.
